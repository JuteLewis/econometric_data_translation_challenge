# econometric_data_translation_challenge

Collaboration with Mikayla Davis, Jennifer Grosz, Arunima Roy, Glen Lewis, and Andrew Nalundasan

This project is a Data Translation Challenge exploring the business impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the US Retail Industry. In particular, this analysis seeks to answer the following question: who has money to spend and what has changed about who is working and earning money as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic?

Starting in September 2015, the College Scorecard was released, providing prospective students a wide range of information about universities that they could apply to such as student demographics, average debt after graduation, admission rates, and median earnings after graduation. In this research assignment, we take a look into how the release of this College Scorecard data has influenced student interest in colleges that predominantly grant bachelorâ€™s degrees.
